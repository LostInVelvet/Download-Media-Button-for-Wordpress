# Download Media Button for Wordpress

This plugin adds a "Download Media" button to the page editor in wordpress. The button allows a user to easily add in a download button on their page to download media from the server. 



# To use:
Go to the desired page or post and hit the button "Insert Download Button" that is up near the top beside "Add Media". If the button is not there, you will need to activate the plugin. Once you select the button, it will pull up the media window and allow you to select what file to add as a download. After you are done, make sure to hit "Update".
